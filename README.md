A philosophical-physical hypothesis proposing that fundamental forces emerge from the geometric properties of spacetime through six distinct "fasteners" or interaction channels.

## üìñ About the Hypothesis

This work presents a novel framework for understanding the geometric nature of physical interactions. The hypothesis suggests that what we perceive as fundamental forces are actually manifestations of spacetime geometry at different density scales.

**Core proposition**: The Casimir force and strong nuclear interaction are unified as different intensity manifestations of the same Z2 fastener mechanism, with the transition occurring at extreme matter densities.

## üéØ Key Insights

- **Geometric unification** of forces through spacetime "fasteners" (Z1-Z6)
- **Density-induced phase transitions** explaining force behavior across scales  
- **Accessible analogies** using everyday objects to visualize complex physics
- **Novel explanation** for the relationship between Casimir effect and strong force
